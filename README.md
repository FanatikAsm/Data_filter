ZenML provides a user-friendly syntax designed for ML workflows, compatible with
any cloud or tool. It enables centralized pipeline management, enabling
developers to write code once and effortlessly deploy it to various
infrastructures.

# 📜 Documentation
ZenML allows you to create and manage your own MLOps platform using 
best-in-class open-source and cloud-based technologies. Here is an example of 
how you could set this up for your team:

## 🔎 1. Filter

For full functionality ZenML should be deployed on the cloud to
enable collaborative features as the central MLOps interface for teams.

![ZenML Architecture Diagram.](docs/book/.gitbook/assets/Scenario3.png)

Currently, there are two main options to deploy ZenML:

- **ZenML Cloud**: With [ZenML Cloud](https://docs.zenml.io/deploying-zenml/zenml-cloud), 
you can utilize a control plane to create ZenML servers, also known as tenants. 
These tenants are managed and maintained by ZenML's dedicated team, alleviating 
the burden of server management from your end. 

- **Self-hosted deployment**: Alternatively, you have the flexibility to [deploy 
ZenML on your own self-hosted environment](https://docs.zenml.io/deploying-zenml/zenml-self-hosted). 
This can be achieved through various methods, including using our CLI, Docker, 
Helm, or HuggingFace Spaces.

## 📋 2. Open and check data filter

ZenML boasts a ton of [integrations](https://zenml.io/integrations) into 
popular MLOps tools. The [ZenML Stack](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide/understand-stacks) 
concept ensures that these tools work nicely together, therefore bringing
structure and standardization into the MLOps workflow.

Deploying and configuring this is super easy with ZenML. For **AWS**, this might 
look a bit like this

```bash
```

When you run a pipeline with this stack set, it will be running on your deployed
Kubernetes cluster.

You can also [deploy your own tooling manually](https://docs.zenml.io/stacks-and-components/stack-deployment).

## 📑 3. New information inside filtered data

Here's an example of a hello world ZenML pipeline in code:

```python
```

```bash
```

## 📛 4. Reset filter block

Open up the ZenML dashboard using this command.

```bash
```
